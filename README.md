Shows how to use Knockout.js library in Grails.

This application follows the book Knockout.js succinctly by Ryan Hodson of Syncfusion.

You can reach the book from this url http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/knockoutjs

This application is not for commercial purpose. This is just for educational purpose.
